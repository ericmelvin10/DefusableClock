  Modificado por ericmelvin10 (Adrian Aceituno) en 2015 para una partida de ROL-paintball.
  El dise침o inicial de nootropic permitia desactivar la bomba cortando tan solo un cable, que era elegido de forma aleatoria.
  En mi dise침o, hay que cortar los cables en un orden determinado para desactivarla, para ello he a침adido una sencilla m치quina de estados.
  
  Modified by ericmelvin10 (Adrian Aceituno) in 2015 for a role paintaball game.
  Nootropic aproach to defuse was based in cutting a random cable. 
  I replaced that function with a simple state machine forcing to cut the cables in a certain order.
